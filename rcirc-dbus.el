;;; Emacs 23 (Emacs CVS as of Feb 2009 comes with dbus bindinds. This
;;; allows some interesting interaction in terms of popup
;;; notifications similar to the ones provided by libnotify
;;; This example notifies via dbus when an "interesting" message
;;; occurs in some buffer (interesting meaning that your nick is
;;; mentioned in a non-server channel by someone other than yourself)
;;; that if clicked and not dismissed changes to the buffer with the
;;; corresponding activity. If in X or other graphical system it also
;;; raises the frame.
;;;
;;; Some initial functions to detect X active window - the window that
;;; has focus - are also included, they could be useful in other settings.
;;;
;;; The following behaviour is expected: when there is activity and
;;; the Emacs frame hasn't got focus then fire up a notification. Note
;;; that if the frame is in focus no notification is sent even if the
;;; activity buffer is not visible: this is by design since this kind
;;; of notifications are are very visible and as such they should be
;;; used sparringly: if Emacs is being used there are other
;;; notification methods with a much lighter footprint.
